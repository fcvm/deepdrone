For the last few years
numerous, newly developed
UAV technologies have been
successfully applied in 
industry and
projects of public interest.
Meanwhile, 
major companies and
research centers across the globe
are researching on further UAV based solutions.
Employing the benefits of machine learning, 
new approaches for autonomous navigation
that outperform traditional approaches 
have been published.
Still, the robustness
of autonomous systems 
is not sufficient to
safely deploy them in many, desired
areas of application. 
Increasing the level of autonomy and
improving robustness,
e.g. enable UAVs to safely operate in 
dynamic environments like urban areas,
is thus, most significant
for further 
integration of
UAV technologies
into public life.

\section{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles}

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),
often referred to as drone, is an
aircraft without a human pilot onboard.
Core components of an UAV are an airframe,
an autopilot, onboard sensors and 
data link. A companion computer
and other optional components,
can be mounted onboard.
Combined with one or more
ground control stations (GCS),
one or more UAVs form an
unmanned aerial systems (UAS).
\cite{Fahlstrom2012}

While the quadcopter is the best-known representative,
various different types of UAVs exist
which are classified by means of
different criteria, i.e.
airframe type, airframe size, flight level, flight range and usage.


\subsection{Classification by Airframe Type}
The airframe type and particular configuration
of an UAV
have big impact on its
capabilities in
various applications 
and environments. \cite{Kong2010}
Three main categories
of airframe types exists -
horizontal take-off and landing (HTOL),
vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)
and hybrids.

\paragraph{HTOL}
HTOLs are foremost represented by airplanes
which are composed of fixed wings
and a propulsion unit.
When moving forward, the wings
generate lift 
by accelerating horizontally incoming
air downwards and compensating
gravitational force.
They also have stabilizing effects
on the aircraft.
Control surfaces on the wings
enable navigation.
%https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32160055/Unmanned_Air_Systems_UAV_Design__Development_and_Deployment.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3Dfor_UAV_design_and_operation.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190910%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190910T014051Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=21449b6e7e8260c2e71e5593e49acfda353cbc2e66d60e046c0469be451f14f4
HTOL is
the most aerodynamically efficient airframe configuration
and therefore, suitable for missions
with high speed as well as
long flight range and time.
\textbf{BSP MISSION}
Since lift generation depends on forward motion,
a HTOL cannot maintain position and
its launching and landing 
require either a runway or
acceleration by human hand or catapults and nets.
\textbf{QUELLE}
Thus, HTOLs cannot be deployed
on missions
which require hovering and lack
launching and landing infrastructure, e.g.
business-to-customer delivery.
\textbf{QUELLE}.

\paragraph{VTOLs}
VTOLs are foremost represented by
copters wich are composed of a single or multiple rotors.
A Copter generates lift by rotating its rotor(s)
and accelerating air downwards.
Since the air is drawn in from above the rotor(s),
a copter is able to hover as well as launch and land vertically.
Besides vertical force,
a running rotor induces also torque
on the aircraft.
In case of a helicopter (single rotor copter),
an additional, small tail rotor
cancels the torque of the main rotor and 
stabilizes the yaw of the aircraft.
In case of a multicopter,
the torques counter themselves
due to the fact that individual rotors
are arranged in opposite directions of rotation.
Depending on configuration, 
navigation is achieved by
adjusting either rotational speed 
or tilt of constituent rotors
in order to
generate differential thrusts and torques.

At the prize of lower flight speed, range and time,
VTOLs are suitable in situations which
require hovering as well as launching and landing on small areas 
without previously built infrastructure.

Multicopters, in turn, are classified by the number
of rotors and their arrangement, e.g. a "quadcopter +" has four rotors
arranged along a symmetric plus sign.
%https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32160055/Unmanned_Air_Systems_UAV_Design__Development_and_Deployment.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3Dfor_UAV_design_and_operation.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190910%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190910T014051Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=21449b6e7e8260c2e71e5593e49acfda353cbc2e66d60e046c0469be451f14f4


The quadcopter is one of the most popular types of
UAV airframe configurations and is also utilized
in this work. However, the insights of this
research should be reproducible for various configurations
of copters since the low-level control
of autopilots is excluded and flight behaviour
does not essentially differentiate.


For multicopters,
electronic complexity in form of multiple motors,
speed controllers and a power distribution board
as well as an autopilot,
which computes individual motor speeds in order to
stabilize the aircraft and follow navigation inputs,
replace the mechanical complexity of
helicopters. 
However, due to extensive cost decrease
and performance increases from the year of 2000 on,
huge markets and broad research on UAVs, exspecially multicopters,
have been established.

\paragraph{Hybrid Systems}
combine benefits of HTOLs and VTOLs,
i.e. the ability of vertical take off and landing
as well as the speed for 
long range flights.
which is usally realized by
either 90 degree tilting rotors or
an array of jets mounted on 
the fixed wings and fuselage of a HTOL.

\subsection{Dynamics and Control}

During flight, an UAV is an unstable system
and requires continual control.
Traditionally, this control is
engineered on multiple control levels.
\textbf{QUELLE}
(except some end-to-end learning control methods).
While on a lower control level,
an onboard autopilot is 
permanently maintaining attitude and altitude of the UAV
in order to prevent 
collisions and keep up maneuverability,
on a higher level, different actors 
can navigate the drone and perform maneuvers.
Either a human pilot steers the UAV remotely from
the GCS per radio transmitter (RC)
thereby, relying on direct visual contact to the vehicle 
or on video stream from an onboard camera,
or an onboard computer constantly executes 
algorithms to track trajectories
thereby, relying on sensor data.
While traditional navigation approaches,
such as VIO or SLAM
evaluate sensor data received from
GPS, radio, inertial, SLAM, VIO
to estimate the pose of the UAV,
new approaches basing
on camera or LIDAR data utilize perception concepts
of machine learning.
These computer tracked trajectories 
are either static,
as part of a
precomputed mission or 
adaptive to dynamic environments
in sense of autonomous flight.

\section{Civil Applications of Multicopters}

UAV technologies have historic origin
in military
affairs from the 1930's.
They had been mostly confined to them
until around the year of 2000,
when along with
rapid performance improvements,
costs of electronic components
have been essentially decreasing 
which made UAV technologies 
accessible for the wider public.
A huge UAV market for private customers
has been established. Many UAV manufacturing
companies have been founded which today,
operate in this worldwide business.

They have been producing
numerous innovative
UAV designs, concepts and algorithms
which in turn around
the year of 2015, opened the door
to industry applications
and projects of public interest
for UAV technologies.

This section introduces these
fields of applications in order
to demonstrate the value to society
that UAV technology has already achieved.
Moreover, the potential of UAV technology
in future applications is discussed,
as well as factors that limits the 
breakthrough into daily life
and the research to eliminate these factors.
Thereby, the focus is on 
business-to-customer (B2C) UAV delivery
which is one of the most relevant future applications
for UAV technology and whose prosperous 
established relies foremost 
on the realization of robust,
autonomous flight in dynamic environments -
a topic this work should contribute.


UAVs are exspecially useful on missions
which are either characterized 
as dangerous, 
i.e. "human pilot operations would be at a disadvantage or at high risk"
\cite{Watts2012}
or as inefficient

\subsection{Agriculture}

According to PwC, one of the largest professional services firms,
%https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601935/six-ways-drones-are-revolutionizing-agriculture/
broader application of UAV technologies in agriculture 
is partial solution to satisfy 
increasing agricultural consumption
in light of the predicted growth of world's population
over the next decades.
In this sense, JD.com,
the second biggest Chinese online retailer
and pioneer in UAV and smart technology,
launched the initiative,
"JD Smart Agriculture Development Community"
with the aim to
"increase the efficiency of China’s agriculture industry" and
"raise the overall level of food safety and quality".
With the help of 
JD-X, JD.com’s logistics innovation lab,
UAV technology is deployed for
crop protection, i.e. to 
"monitor and analyze water, soil, pesticides, fertilizer, weather, diseases and pests".
%https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-cultivates-new-smart-agriculture-push-in-china/




Currently, UAVs operate in
the fields of
soil and field analysis,
planting,
crop spraying,
crop monitoring,




<
1. Soil and field analysis: 
Drones can be instrumental at the start of the crop cycle. 
They produce precise 3-D maps for early soil analysis, 
useful in planning seed planting patterns. 
After planting, drone-driven soil analysis provides data for 
irrigation and nitrogen-level management.

2. Planting: 
Startups have created drone-planting systems 
that achieve an uptake rate of 75 percent and 
decrease planting costs by 85 percent. 
These systems shoot pods with seeds and 
plant nutrients into the soil, 
providing the plant all the nutrients 
necessary to sustain life.

3. Crop spraying: 
Distance-measuring equipment—
ultrasonic echoing and 
lasers such as those used in the light-detection and ranging, 
or LiDAR, method—
enables a drone to adjust altitude 
as the topography and geography vary, and 
thus avoid collisions. 
Consequently, drones can scan the ground and 
spray the correct amount of liquid, 
modulating distance from the ground and 
spraying in real time for even coverage. 
The result: increased efficiency 
with a reduction of in the amount of chemicals 
penetrating into groundwater. 
In fact, experts estimate that aerial spraying 
can be completed up to five times faster with drones 
than with traditional machinery.

4. Crop monitoring: 
Vast fields and low efficiency in crop monitoring together 
create farming’s largest obstacle. 
Monitoring challenges are exacerbated 
by increasingly unpredictable weather conditions, 
which drive risk and field maintenance costs. 
Previously, satellite imagery offered the most advanced form of monitoring. 
But there were drawbacks. 
Images had to be ordered in advance, 
could be taken only once a day, 
and were imprecise. 
Further, services were extremely costly and 
the images’ quality typically suffered on certain days. 
Today, time-series animations 
can show the precise development of a crop and 
reveal production inefficiencies, 
enabling better crop management.

5. Irrigation: 
Drones with hyperspectral, multispectral, or thermal sensors 
can identify which parts of a field are dry or need improvements. 
Additionally, once the crop is growing, 
drones allow the calculation of the vegetation index, 
which describes the relative density and health of the crop, 
and show the heat signature, the amount of energy or heat the crop emits.

6. Health assessment: 
It’s essential to assess crop health and 
spot bacterial or fungal infections on trees. 
By scanning a crop using both visible and near-infrared light, 
drone-carried devices can identify 
which plants reflect different amounts of green light and NIR light. 
This information can produce multispectral images 
that track changes in plants and indicate their health. 
A speedy response can save an entire orchard. 
In addition, as soon as a sickness is discovered, 
farmers can apply and monitor remedies more precisely. 
These two possibilities increase a plant’s ability to overcome disease. 
And in the case of crop failure, 
the farmer will be able to document losses more efficiently for insurance claims.

\subsection{Delivery service} \cite{Watts2012}
%https://mydroneauthority.com/industry/drone-delivery/


\paragraph{Introduction}
tests are being conducted, 
what big companies and startups are doing, \
and where it is possible to see the technology in action.


For a few years the idea of 
delivery drones transporting parcels, food and other goods
directly to customers
has manifested in several pioeneer applications. 
Researchers are working hard on this hot topic
which will reduce delivery time,
costs.

\paragraph{Potential}
Drone delivery technologies have big potential
of improvements in various aspects.

From economic considerations,
drone delivery is a better solution to the "last mile problem"
which refers to the high costs occurring during the last, inefficient step of supply chains.
On short distances from a transportation hub to final destinations,
drones can be faster while consuming less fuel. Costs related
to traditional delivery on the "last mile" such as
<labor costs for human drivers> and <fleet maintenance of commercial vehicles>
are omitted.
https://www.statista.com/statistics/816884/last-mile-delivery-logistics-providers-challenges/

In the field of healthcare,
drones show promise to speed up emergency response
where the time from incident to first measure is 
most critical and 
congestion might be fatal.
Hastening the supply of emergency medicine,
donated blood and portable medical devices as well as
enabeling paramedics to instruct helpers on site from a far distance
is life saving in case of misfortunes like 
heart attacks, strokes and external injuries.

Because drones are electrically powered, they provide benefits
with respect to climate protection if batteries
are recharged with renewable resources. Moreover,
the operation of drones is emmision-free and thus,
an answer to the air pollution problems
which occurs in metropoles across the globe [QUELLEN Deutschland, China, Indien, USA].

<overcoming delivery problems to remote areas>


\paragraph{Applications}

The concept of commercial drone delivery started in 2013
when Amazon announced their initiative "Amazon Prime Air" of developing drone systems for 
parcel delivery.
%https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/technology/think-amazons-drone-delivery-idea-is-a-gimmick-think-again.html

Within less than a week, UPS reacted on the new competitor in its core business with
announcing their own plans of drone delivery.

%https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/12/ups-delivery-drones.html 

Trapped by regulations

FAA rules currently prohibit drone flights 
that are entirely autonomous or 
beyond the line of sight of human operators. 
7-Eleven has managed to work within those regulations
by using its delivery service as a means to advance research 
toward integrating drones into the National Airspace System, 
while also helping further refine Flirtey’s delivery technology.



Nevertheless, in the shadow of these gigantic players,
in July 2015 Flirtey, an Australian start-up, performed the first
federally-approved commercial drone flight in the U.S.

Thereupon in July 2016, Flirtey in corporation with 
the convenience store chain 7-Eleven 
performed the first "store-to-door" drone deliveries to private customers
in the US with an autonomously flying drone relying on precision GPS.

In December 2016, Amazon caught up with its first drone delivery
in the UK.

\paragraph{Limiting factors}
The breakthrough of drone delivery
has not been taken place yet due to several
limiting factors.

In contrast to the previously mentioned
environment-friendly abilities,
current, typical drone models emit a buzzing noize.
Thus, an extensive application of drone delivery,
would lead to new, dominant source of noise pollution 
which affects the quality of life in urban areas.



Safety Concerns - include damage and injury caused by 
accidents, 
flyaways, 
privacy issues, 
security, and 
package interference from stealing or vandalism. 

Due to little experience of drones
participating in daily traffic,
consequences of traffic accidents caused
by drones are difficult to predict. 
There have not been recorded any fatal commercial drone crash until now
%(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291697791_A_Technocritical_Review_of_Drones_Crash_Risk_Probabilistic_Consequences_and_its_Societal_Acceptance),
???and the risk of autonomous flight is estimated very low ?????
%(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27467796_A_Casualty_Risk_Analysis_For_Unmanned_Aerial_System_UAS_Operations_Over_Inhabited_Areas) 
but a lot of near-accidents and injuries are reported

.
Not least because of the uncontrolled nature of drone crashes,
the deploy of drone technologies in daily life is seen critically by
local administrations and
is legally restricted by local laws of the states.
??autonomous and human pilot.??
To give a few examples, 
in the United States of America, 
law forbids the navigation of drones above other persons Quelle!!!(December 2018) 
In cities, drone delivery would be only legally possible on air corridors for drones
and would lose its advantage of not being bound to existing infrastructure
and thus, could be affected by congestion and circuitous routes.
Moreover, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States,
out-of-sight drone navigation with a virtual reality headset needs a special permission
which further limits drone delivery in not fully visible delivery areas like cities.
autonomous???

Privacy is another concern when it comes to drone navigation
and led to legal restriction.
Drone systems are equipped with different sensors,
visual, range, can look through walls etc.
and would enter spheres which until now have not been
reached by them. A single drone can look through windows at high levels
or see what happens behind a tall fence. A whole fleet of
delivery drones can profile entire societies if their data
is combined and evaluated with methods of artificial intelligence.
%https://www.pwc.pl/en/drone-powered-solutions/Articles/Can-drones-see-through-walls.html

By law, unauthorizedly overflying restricted areas of critical infrastructure 
such as nuclear power plants
%https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291697791_A_Technocritical_Review_of_Drones_Crash_Risk_Probabilistic_Consequences_and_its_Societal_Acceptance
and military bases is forbidden.
Losing control of drones in case of navigation failure or hacker attack
can be punished by heavy fines or even imprisonment.

Another concern is the security of delivered items
which decisively affects the consumers to accept this new way of delivery.
%https://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Do-Consumers-Feel-About-Drones-Delivering-Their-Packages/1014138
Finding convenient solutions to criminal actions such as the downing of drones 
or the stealth of delivered parcels as well as 
technical questions, e.g. protection of the parcel against rain and outer forces
as well as a robust approach of handing it over, are crucial here.


<Realistically, however, implementation could take three to five years, and that’s just to get FAA approval. There may be other problems, too, in densely populated cities like Washington D.C. where no-fly zones are currently in place.

Brendan Schulman, special counsel at Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP told the Associated Press:

    The technology has moved forward faster than the law has kept pace.>

Edgar Herrera, developed a blade-less drone. 
It flies in complete silence. 
The drone is not yet in production; 
however, the design is spectacular. 
Solar-powered, silent-flying, drone delivery is a really great idea that takes this whole concept to the next level.
In the future, there may be overly-active, 
drone-flying corridors that are constantly buzzing.

<Using drones equipped with emergency parachutes, 
which automatically deploy for power losses, 
can help reduce crash damage and injuries. 
There are plenty of opportunities for entrepreneurs to improve drone-flying safety. >

\section{Autonomous Navigation Systems of Small Quadcopter UAVs}

For legal classification and restriction,
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
devides UAVs into either fully remotely controlled 
or fully autonomous.
%https://www.icao.int/Meetings/UAS/Documents/Circular%20328_en.pdf
From technical perspective,
autonomy is not a static
but a fluent feature of an UAV
and thus, more precisely referred to as
degree of autonomy. For example,
even a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV)
usually involves an autopilot
which supports the human pilot
during flight by autonomously
performing tasks, e.g. maintaining pose.
%and translation of higher order navigation tasks
%to individual lower level motor commands.
This section recaps a general
concept of autonomy as well as
a hierarchical control architecture for a
fully autonomous UAV in order to
subsequently introduce
autonomous navigation systems of UAVs.
Traditional and newly developed methods
related to autonomous navigation
as well as 
the research of this work are classified.



\subsection{Autonomy}
The concept of autonomy extends
automation 
onto unexpected situations. 
Automation replaces human action
to complete well known tasks in well known, structured environments.
While an automated system outperforms humans
with respect to 
precision, speed and costs,
it is unable to
cope with unexpected situations
since it is engineered to rely on limited
parameters, variations and disturbances.
In contrast,
an autonomous system, 
due to a deeper based perception,
is additionally capable of anticapating upcoming events,
making decisions and reacting properly - like humans.
It can perform previously unknown tasks
in totally unknown, dynamically changing environments,
deal with uncertainty and learn from its failures.
The design of an autonomous system
requires the composition of
various methods from 
control theory,
system identification, 
system estimation,
communication theory,
computer science (in particular artificial intelligence)
and
operations research.
With machines making decisions,
new questions concerning
ethics,
responsibility,
legality
arise.


\subsection{Hierarchical Control Architecture of a Fully Autonomous UAV}

In contrast to RPV...

Involving the concept of 
increasing precision with decreasing intelligence (IPDI),
control architectures of autonomous systems for UAVs 
can be functionally layered
into three control levels, i.e.
organization, coordination, and execution
as well as a supervisor level
to enable human intervention.

Downstream, from higher to lower levels,
commands are distributed and
system parameters are modified.

Upstream, from lower to higher level,
command responses and sensor data
%e.g. status, health information, 
are passed.

Information may also be exchanged within the same level.

The higher the control level,
the longer the interval of planning and execution time.



All three levels have access to
information about 
environment and state estimates of the UAV.

The least intelligent \textbf{execution level}
interfaces with sensors and actuators
of the UAV. While receiving sensor data about
the state of the UAV and the environment,
this level runs conventional  control  algorithms 
on inner-loop and sends low level control
commands directly to the actuators of the UAV.



(These algortightms very good researched)




It  senses  the  responses  of  the  vehicle  and  environment,    
processes    them    to    identify    parameters,    
estimates   states,   or   detects   failures,   
and   passes   this   information to the higher levels.


\paragraph{Organization Level}

highest   intelligent    and    lowest    precision
involves    intelligent,    decision-making  methods,  
situation  evaluation  and  mission  management. 




\paragraph{Coordination Level}

The  middle  level
interface between the actions of the other  two  levels  
combination  of  conventional  and   intelligent   decision   making   methods.   
outer-loop

middle-loop  to  generate  the  trajectory,  guidance  and  other  signals

In case of a small UAV,
one major point is to
guarantee that the algorithms
can be executed in real time
since onboard hardware is constrained
by small payloads.



\paragraph{Challenges}





<
There  has  been  many  significant  research  in  making  UAV  fly  autonomously,  but  obstacle  avoidance  is  still  a  crucial   hurdle.   For   small   quadrotor   UAV,   due   to   the   limitation  of  payloads  it  is  infeasible  to  carry  sophisticated  radar  sensors.  Though  many  advanced  research  has  used  light  detection  and  ranging(LiDAR)  [1]  or  the  cameras  of  Microsoft Kinect [2], both sensors are heavy, which will lead to  increase  the  power  consumption  and  drastically  decrease  the flight time.

Autonomous flight is in contrast to other
control methods, i.e. radio remote and preprogrammed.
    communication  link  is  not  expedited  or  reliable
    doesn’t  update  mission  when  plans  or  treat  situations  are  changed
    rapidly  changing  uncertain  environment the present techniques are inadequat

perform  well  under  significant  uncertainties  inthe  system  and  environment for extended periods of time
compensate  for  system  failures  without  external  intervention

techniques  from  the  field  of  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  
    evolve  from  conventional  control  systems  by  adding  intelligent  components,  and  their  development requires interdisciplinary research [3]. 

Autonomous  controllers  have  the  power  and  ability  for  self  governance  in  the  performance  of  control  functions.
high  degree   of   automation   is   applied   in   a   very   unstructured   environment
“Automation”  here  refers  to  the  absence  of  human   intervention,
“unstructured   environment”   is   associated with uncertainty

integrates concepts and methods from areas such as Control, Identification,   Estimation,   and   Communication   Theory,   Computer   Science,   especially   Artificial   Intelligence,   and   Operations  Research  (OR).  
The   synthesis   of   high   performance   controllers  for  the  solution  of  difficult  control  problems  is  what autonomous control is really all about.

Due to the inherent instability of the system, constant control commands must be applied to
prevent a collision. In the event the robot enters an environment where \textbf{accurate state estimation}
is computationally impossible due to lack of features, we still want the system to do its best given
available information to prevent immediate collision.
