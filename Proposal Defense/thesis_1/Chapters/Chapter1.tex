Searching and finding, ordering and paying, possibly reclaming - 
all of it, nowadays, only one click away.
Nevertheless, the final step, shipping the package is
still lasting for days. 
Unfortunately, traditionally grown structures
have not been able to keep up with the 
flexibility gained by digital revolution.
And they will never be able to, unless
packages will be shipped through the real world
as quick as information can be send - with the speed of light.
Great advancements in parcel shipping are still sight.
Globally operating as well as regularly sized companies and
also universities are building the foundation for 
parcel shipment by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).
Thereby autonomous flight, more precisely the robustness, i.e. safety
as well as speed and feasibility, is the hot topic. Since it is the key to
responsibely and economically apply this new technic in our cities and villages.
Mastering autonomous flight of UAVs is not only crucial to 
parcel delivery by drones but also will enable to apply drones in more fields,
e.g. "aerial surveillance, delivery, or monitoring of existing architectures"
\cite{loquercio2018learning}.
