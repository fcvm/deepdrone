*Description*

They developed a supervised learning method which enabled a vision-based quadrocopter
to autonomously traverse through a drone-racing track with high agility. 
While the drone was exclusively trained in static environments, in test it was capable of
flying through moving race track gates, i. e. it handled navigating through **dynamic environments**.
Thereby, the drone did not require any explicit map of the environment, but
only localize itself relative to the next gate relying on camera images. All computation
run fully onboard.
